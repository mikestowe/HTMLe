	/*
	 * To access this HTMLe plugin, all you need to do is call the HTMLe tag identical
	 * to the page name minus the .php extension.  So to access the hello.php plugin,
	 * just use the {hello} tag in your post.
	 *
	 * Also, any attributes listed would be supplied as $params['attribute_name']
	 * For example, if the tag where {hello color="white"} we would be able to access
	 * the Color attribute value by calling upon $params['color'] in our function.
	 * 
	 * Each HTMLe tag is given the potential for unlimited attributes, so the sky's
	 * the limit... just use this power wisely.
	 *
	 * Oh yeah, try to avoid using 'echo' and 'print' in your function as they will output
	 * the data before it is prepared, making your site look really goofy.  You should also
	 * send it back using a 'return' instead.

	 * HTMLe_($filename excluding the .php%) otherwise you may just end up causing the end of 
	 * the world... which would be very, very bad...
	 *
	 * Oh, and if you would like to be able to call this function by itself, you can now use the
	 * child method, or {hello:subfunction}, and yes even {hello:subfunction color="blue"}.  Just
	 * make sure you use the proper naming convention for your plugin's child function, that being
	 * HTMLe_%plugin-name%_%subfunction-name% or in the case of plugin "hello" it would be (as
	 * shown above, HTML_hello_subfunction.
